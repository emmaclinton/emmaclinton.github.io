title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

This is a reflection on the readings of the week of 02/26/21 regarding Open Source GIScience.


	Open source software refers to software that has available source code and is licensed in a manner which permits reuse, adaptation, and redistribution (either at no cost or for profit). Open source software is often referred to interchangeably with free software. This is, for the most part, correct, when free is considered to mean accessible, modifiable, and redistributable. Free software, though, is focused more on the freedoms of users, while some open source licenses are seen as infringing on those freedoms, or not strong enough to protect them. Free software can be thought of as a subset of open-source software that *always* follows the core freedoms of free software specified by the Free Software Foundation. However, other forms of no-charge software—freeware and shareware—are not the same as free software. Freeware and shareware come at no cost (with shareware distributed on a trial basis, with the implication that users with pay to continue to use the software after their trial has ended), but neither of these forms of software tend to have source code available to users and are therefore not modifiable. To be free in the sense of free software, source code must be made available to users.

	OpenGIScience fits well within the context of a liberal arts undergraduate education. Community building and collaboration across disciplines are appealing aspects of the growing field of Open Source GIScience, as this kind of diversity and intersectionality is valued and emphasized in liberal arts institutions. Using Open Source GIScience and experiencing the collaborative nature of such work teaches students to be open about their ideas. It also introduces them to the “gift currency” that builds reputation within Open Source communities, shifting the notion of achievement from one of personal gain and ownership towards one of offering assistance and experience to others working towards a common goal. This kind of collaborative learning at an undergraduate level may be useful in helping students overcome the steep learning curve of Open Source GIS. Of course, the implications for learning and evaluation change somewhat when the classroom takes on the form of an Open Source GIScience community. The focus shifts from individual performance alone to how well an individual works with others and how willing they are to contribute to the group in a positive manner. Effort is still a central component of evaluation, but a focus on guarding one’s “academic secrets” does not mesh well with a community-based learning experience. 

The main organization for open source GIS is [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/).
