title: GIS as Reproducible Science
---

This week, we considered the question of how to categorize GIS (as in geographic information *systems*). Is it a tool or is it itself a science? The question of what it means to be “doing GIS” is a question I have never deeply considered, but is quite an important one. 

 Wright et al. (2010) state that GIS can be considered as three different categories: as a tool, as toolmaking, or as a subject of study or science. They argue that GIS can only be considered as a science the context of it being a subject of study (e.g. in the context of the social implications of its use).

In order to lend meaning to this argument, it is important to try and pin down a definition of “science.” “Rigorous collection and evaluation of data in the production of knowledge” as per Karl Popper’s “‘positivism’” and “’critical rationalism’” (1959) (c.b. Wright et al., 2010) seems a fitting definition.

Thinking of GIS as a tool seems to be equivalent to seeing these “systems” as computer applications and associated techniques that only gain meaning when scientists apply knowledge (Wright et al., 2010). In this context, GIS is more related to solving, rather than understanding, problems. “Doing GIS” as a means to “do geography” seems to be a sensible stance to take on this issue. The tool is a neutral, yet essential, aspect of the process of investigation.

Thinking of GIS as toolmaking

Thinking of GIS as a science entails using GIS to develop and test theories (Wright et al., 2010). The use of GIS as a tool is grounded in scientifically proven concepts, and the development of GIS can be thought of as science.

The implications of GIS is certainly something I have been taught to consider, especially when analyzing instances of segregation, environmental injustice, etc.

One comment in this article really stood out to me: “GIS is the application of spatial science to the study of earthbound objects” (Wright et al., 2010). I think this resonated with many of the experiences I have had while learning GIS: I have been working mostly in a GUI format and view the GIS element of a task as a means to an end (in other words, I have implicitly learned to understand that GIS is a tool). Since we use GIS to represent and analyze data to test theories about the physical world, I have a hard time disentangling GIS from the overall study of geography and other disciplines like remote sensing and cartography (essentially, as a method to “do science”). This might be because I have no real experience with software and proper methodology development; I could see how that aspect of GIS would certainly count as a science.  

Breakthroughs and developments in GIS design could certainly be counted as scientific, as they further the capabilities of knowledge generation. The “GIS as engineering” argument is applicable here, though. GIS and engineering are both methods of “problem-solving” (Wright et al., 2010), but those methods of development are grounded in scientific and tested principles. (Likewise, “the design PRINCIPLES of GIS are ‘scientific’” [Wright et al., 2010]). This is why geographers make good GIS toolmakers: they understand geographic concepts and physical processes that GIS analyses often seeks to study (Wright et al., 2010).
