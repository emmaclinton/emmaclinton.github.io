title: Ethics of Volunteered Geographic Information
---
There is certainly an interesting question of privacy and what is revealed when using crowd-sourced/volunteered geographic information (VGI). The sharing of location data and information revealing “vulnerability” during crisis events could expose personal sensitive information. In addition, when formulating a response to something as impactful as a natural disaster, it is necessary to consider the limitations of data of this nature. Power outages, lost connections, or overwhelming situations can lead to only a partial representation of the scope of a disaster scenario. There are questions of representation and, as we saw in the Wang et al. (2016) reading, hierarchies of who consistently gets retweeted (i.e. who has a voice). This was reflected in the Mission 4636 response network in Haiti, and the ethical concerns surrounding this dynamic are complicated by the limited awareness of those involved in generating the data regarding how it is to be used. A language barrier also comes into play post-translation to English, and this combined with data permissions or costs raises important questions of data access.

As we discussed in class, user-generated information can be empowering. However, there is also a high risk of untruthfulness to this type of data (intentional or not). Not all demographics are well-represented in these data; rather, there is a high representation of young, wealthy, urban-dwelling individuals. The issue of bot accounts must also be considered. When using this kind of data, it must be acknowledged that it is incomplete.

Additionally, Crawford and Finn (2014) bring up an excellent point: Twitter is not a neutral space. The practice of tweeting is influenced by the development of an event and the content of the tweets others are posting or retweeting. This introduces bias and feeds into differences in representation. There is generally no separation of emotion and fact in the contents of a tweet.

The authors’ discussion of the context in which information is shared raises important questions about situational priorities and how the effects of actions in difficult moments may linger long after a disaster “event” has occurred. The “for the greater good” approach to crisis mapping seems to muffle these concerns, and also those concerning representation or biases in the data (Crawford and Finn, 2014). Ultimately, this can result in “forced consent.”
