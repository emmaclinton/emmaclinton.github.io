title: Greenspace Access in PostGIS using Open Street Map Data
---

In this analysis, we attempt to use SQL queries in PostGIS to answer a simple spatial question about environmental justice in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. [Drew An-Pham](https://daptx.github.io/) and I collaborated on this lab. Here, we attempt to answer a simple spatial question about access to greenspaces in this growing city: *What percent of residences in each of the public administrative wards are within 0.25 km of a public greenspace?*
