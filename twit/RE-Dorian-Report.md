## Abstract

Why study the spatial distribution of Twitter data?

Wang et al (2016) analyzed Twitter data for wildfires in California, finding that the social media data coupled spatially and temporally with wildfire activity. They also found that spatial information and information about fire-related damage and responses are frequently communicated during such events. Interestingly, there was strong separation between hubs of retweet activity (i.e. users who are frequently retweeted, such as media or authority figures) and less popular users, with only hubs being consistently retweeted and other users not being retweeted nor retweeting other users who are not frequently retweeted.

Holler (2021) is studying Twitter data for Hurricane Dorian on the Atlantic coast, finding that in spite of tending news and social media content regarding a false narrative of risk, original Tweets still clustered significantly along the real hurricane track, and only along the hurricane track.

Reproducing and replicating spatial research of data regarding the social media implications of natural disasters continues to be relevant for many reasons. There are many ethical considerations regarding the sharing of private information and access to disaster data. This data also has potential for high utility regarding designing response networks in future disaster scenarios and getting help to those on the ground in future scenarios.

In his replication study, I will analyze Twitter activity data regarding a recent hurricane warning from April 28, 2021 - May 05, 2021 in Georgia and several surrounding states to see how this severe storm influenced people's social media activity.


## Original Study Information

The original study by Wang et al (2016) used the Twitter Search API using a two-phase search for data collection. The first phase involved searching for "fire" or "wildfire" in Tweets, while the second phase pulled out fire-related tweets associated with specific locations (i.e. associated with specific wildfires). Data mining was done using the `tm` package in `R` and data was cleaned by removing URLs and stop words. Wang et al. (2016) used kernel density estimation to determine hot spots of Twitter activity, normalized by population data. K-means clustering was used to determine which terms most frequently appeared together. This analysis found that there was strong spatial and temporal coupling of wildfire activity and Twitter activity, and that spatial coupling strengthened when Twitter data were normalized by population. It is not known what GIS platform was used to carry out this spatial analysis.

Wang et al. (2016) also conducted a social network analysis to determine which users were "hubs" of information and were frequently retweeted and retweeted mainly only other large hubs of information. This process required the `igraph` package in `R`. A social network analysis was built from this retweet information showing how information diffuses through a network. The findings of this analysis indicate that there exists strong separation between hubs of retweet activity (i.e. users who are frequently retweeted, such as media or authority figures) and less popular users, with only hubs being consistently retweeted and other users not being retweeted nor retweeting other users who are not frequently retweeted.

Holler (2021) loosely replicated the methods of Wang et al (2016) for the case of Hurricane Dorian's landfall on the U.S. mainland during the 2019 Atlantic Hurricane season. Data in the original study was based on Twitter Search API queries for "fire" and "wildfire." They then further filtered by location, using geotags "San Marcos" and "Bernardo."

Holler modified Wang et al's methods by not searching for retweets for network analysis, focusing instead on original Tweet content with keywords hurricane, Dorian, or sharpiegate (a trending hashtag referring to the storm). Holler modified the methodology for normalizing tweet data by creating a Normalized Tweet Difference Index (NTDI) and extended the methodology to test for spatial clustering with the local Getis-Ord statistic. The study tested a hypothesis that false narratives of hurricane risk promulgated at the highest levels of the United States government would significantly distort the geographic distribution of Twitter activity related to the hurricane and its impacts, finding that original Twitter data still clustered only in the affected areas of the Atlantic coast in spite of false narratives about risk of a westward track through Alabama.

The replication study by Holler (2021) used R, including the rtweet, rehydratoR, igraph, sf, and spdep packages for analysis.

## Materials and Procedure

The script needed to replicate the data search is included [here](/procedure/code/01-tornado-search.r). This research searched for tweets from the week leading up to May 04, 2021 within 3,000 mi of Atlanta, GA, where a tornado watch was issued. The keywords included in this search were "tornado", "warning", "shelter", and "storm." Baseline data on Twitter activity to compare with the tornado tweets and to create the Normalized Tweet Difference Index (NTDI) as per Holler (2021) were also generated. The search for this baseline data was essentially the inverse of the search for the tornado data and excluded all tweets that contained the above keywords.

[Baseline tweet ids for rehydration](/data/derived/public/GAbaselineids.txt)

[This script](/procedure/code/02-analyze-tornado.r) contains the procedure for several analyses run on these tweets. First, tweets were analyzed temporally to determine when tornado-related activity was high. The script also details how the tweet contents were graphed to see which terms occurred most frequently, and they were also mapped and compared to [population density data](/data/derived/public/counties.RDS) from the US Census.

In [this script](/procedure/code/04-spatial-clustering-tornado.r), the NTDI (Holler, 2021) was created by comparing the tornado tweets to the baseline tweets using the formula NTDI = (tornado - base) / (tornado + base). A spatial cluster analysis was also implemented to reveal areas where Twitter activity differed significantly from the norm during the temporal range of the tornado warning.

## Replication Results

The temporal analysis of tweet activity in the region yielded the results shown in **Fig. 1.** There was clearly an increase in tornado-related Twitter activity around May 4.

_Fig. 1. Temporal analysis._

The content analysis graph shown in **Fig. 2** counts the instances of unique words found in tweets, and it is clear that "watch," which was not included as a keyword in this analysis, showed up frequently in tornado-related tweets.

Finally, **Fig. 4** shows the cluster hotspot analysis to show where there was significant deviation from baseline Twitter data.

## Unplanned Deviations from the Protocol

There is certainly room for uncertainty in the selection of keywords in this analysis. In addition, the fact that not all tweets (in fact, the majority of tweets) are not geotagged means that much information is left out in this analysis. Wang et al. (2016) also did not include information about the GIS platform that they used in their kernel density analysis, meaning that there is probability that our analysis differs from theirs.

## Discussion

![Fig. 5](/twit/results/figures/may5tornado.png)

_Fig. 5. NOAA Tornado Warning (May 05)._

When comparing **Fig 3** and **Fig. 4** with **Fig. 5**, it does appear that a great deal of Twitter activity paralleled the tornado tracks
